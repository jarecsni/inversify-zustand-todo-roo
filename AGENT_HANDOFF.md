# Agent Handoff Document - Unified Store Architecture Implementation

## üéØ Mission Brief
Cooper and I just had a brilliant architectural discussion in chat mode. We're simplifying the overcomplicated 3-store system into a single, elegant unified store. This document contains everything Agent-Me needs to implement our decisions.

## üß† Context from Chat Discussion

### The Problem We Solved
- Original architecture had 3 separate store types (collections, singleValues, keyValuePairs) 
- This was overengineering - solving problems that don't exist yet
- Components were directly accessing stores, violating separation of concerns

### Our Solution: Unified Store Architecture
1. **Single MasterStore** - One store to rule them all
2. **StoreView<T> Pattern** - Typed views into store slices
3. **Service Layer Enforcement** - Components ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Store (never skip layers)
4. **Type Safety Throughout** - Full TypeScript support for any data pattern

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions Made

### Data Flow Pattern
```
Component ‚Üí Service ‚Üí MasterStore ‚Üí StoreView<T> ‚Üí Zustand
```

### Key Principles
- Components NEVER directly access stores
- Services inject MasterStore and get typed views
- Each service gets exactly the data shape it needs
- Store implementation is completely hidden from components

## üìÅ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Store (DONE ‚úÖ)
- [x] Created `src/store/MasterStore.ts` with StoreView<T> pattern
- [x] Unified state interface with key-value storage
- [x] Cached typed views for performance

### Phase 2: Update Services (TODO)
1. **Update TodoService** (`src/services/TodoService.ts`):
   - Inject MasterStore instead of ITodoStore
   - Get typed view: `masterStore.getStore<Todo[]>('todos', [])`
   - Update all methods to use StoreView API

2. **Create ThemeService** (`src/services/ThemeService.ts`):
   - Example of storing single object: `masterStore.getStore<Theme>('theme', DEFAULT_THEME)`
   - Show how different data patterns work with same store

### Phase 3: Update Container (TODO)
- Update `src/container/container.ts`:
  - Remove ITodoStore binding
  - Add MasterStore binding
  - Update TYPES in `src/container/types.ts`

### Phase 4: Update Components (TODO)
- Components should only change in how they use services
- Remove any direct store access
- Use the `useStoreData` hook pattern we discussed

## üîß Key Code Patterns

### Service Pattern
```typescript
@injectable()
export class TodoService implements ITodoService {
  private todoStore: ReturnType<MasterStore['getStore']>;

  constructor(
    @inject(TYPES.MasterStore) masterStore: MasterStore
  ) {
    this.todoStore = masterStore.getStore<Todo[]>('todos', []);
  }

  addTodo(text: string): void {
    this.todoStore.update(todos => [...todos, newTodo]);
  }
}
```

### Component Pattern
```typescript
export const TodoApp: React.FC = () => {
  const todoService = useService<ITodoService>(TYPES.TodoService);
  const todos = useStoreData(todoService, () => todoService.getTodos());
  
  const handleAddTodo = (text: string) => {
    todoService.addTodo(text); // Service handles everything
  };
}
```

## üß™ Testing Strategy
- Mock services, not stores
- Test container can swap MasterStore for MockMasterStore
- Each service gets isolated mock data through test container

## üìã Files to Create/Update

### New Files:
- ‚úÖ `src/store/MasterStore.ts` (DONE)
- `src/services/ThemeService.ts` (example service)
- `src/hooks/useStoreData.ts` (clean subscription hook)

### Update Files:
- `src/services/TodoService.ts` (use MasterStore)
- `src/container/container.ts` (bind MasterStore)
- `src/container/types.ts` (add MasterStore type)
- `src/components/TodoApp.tsx` (use service-only pattern)
- `src/types/container.ts` (add theme interfaces)

### Remove Files:
- `src/store/Store.ts` (replaced by MasterStore)
- Any other old store implementations

## üéØ Success Criteria
1. Components never directly import or use store classes
2. All data flows through services
3. Services use MasterStore.getStore<T>() for typed access
4. Tests can easily mock services through container
5. Adding new data types is trivial (just call getStore with new type)

## üí° Agent Notes
- The MasterStore is already created and follows the exact pattern we discussed
- Focus on updating TodoService first - it's the main example
- The beauty is in the simplicity - one store, many typed views
- Remember: Components ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Store (never skip layers!)

## üöÄ Ready for Implementation
Agent-Me, you have everything you need! The architecture is solid, the core store is built, and the path forward is clear. Time to make this beautiful unified store architecture a reality.

Cooper is counting on you to execute this flawlessly. Don't let him down! ü§ñ
